The appendix:
“Professions for Women” is an abbreviated version of the speech Virginia  Woolf delivered before a branch of the National Society for Women’s  Service on January 21, 1931; it was published posthumously in The Death  of the Moth and Other Essays. On the day before the speech, she wrote in  her diary: “I have this moment, while having my bath, conceived an entire  new book—a sequel to a Room of One’s Own—about the sexual life of  women: to be called Professions for Women perhaps—Lord how  exciting!” More than a year and a half later, on October 11, 1932,  Virginia Woolf began to write her new book: “THE PARGITERS: An  Essay based upon a paper read to the London/National Society for  women’s service.” “The Pargiters” evolved into The Years and was  published in 1937. The book that eventually did become the sequel to A  Room of One’s Own was Three Guineas (1938), and its first working title  was “Professions for Women.”  The essay printed here concentrates on that Victorian phantom known as  the Angel in the House (borrowed from Coventry Patmore’s poem  celebrating domestic bliss)—that selfless, sacrificial woman in the  nineteenth century whose sole purpose in life was to soothe, to flatter, and  to comfort the male half of the world’s population. “Killing the Angel in  the House,” wrote Virginia Woolf, “was part of the occupation of a  woman writer.” That ahs proved to be a prophetic statement, for today,  not only in the domain of letters, but in the entire professional world,  women are still engaged in that deadly contest in their struggle for social  and economic equality.  --Mitchell A .
